# BDSPScriptCommandsDecomp

This is a decompilation of the Script Commands used in Pok√©mon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl's ev_script script language.\
This is meant as reference, and will not be executable.\
What you're most likely gonna be looking at is RunEvCmd() in Dpr/EvScript/EvDataManager.cs.\
Every time a float-typed argument is used, assume that the float conversion is already done and that it is read properly (if it's not explicitely detailed). There is a lot of casting that is skipped over in this decomp to simplify it.
